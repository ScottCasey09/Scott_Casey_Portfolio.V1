    <h1>Casey Scott</h1>
  
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Casey and I am 28 years old. I have been working for what feels like all my life, but really it has only been since I was sixteen (12+ yrs.). In this time I have held leadership positions running assembly line crews and operating a very small painting company where I managed entire projects from estimation to completion. But starting a year ago I have chose to become an aspiring mobile application developer with a dream; to one day build applications that can be used and enjoyed by people around the globe. I am currently attending Full Sail University's Mobile Develop Bachelors Degree program. One year into my mobile development program I have created small web pages using HTML and beginner programs in the C# language. At this point it's early in my career and I have a lot more work to do, but I have shown some promising progress so far. When I'm not studying I love to be active by running, lifting weights, and playing golf. I enjoy shooter and strategy video games. </p>
