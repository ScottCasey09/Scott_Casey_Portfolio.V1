Reflect and Connect

Before the start of this week I knew nothing about version control systems or the use of a terminal. I believe I have gained knowledge in the basics of the use of a VCS and learned some of the basic commands for Git within a Terminal. At one point I had everything going smooth and then I crashed and burned by getting lost inside the terminal. I put the terminal down and restarted my Portfolio in a new repo. Since the restart of my project, I have had more success just using the desktop program to make my commits. Next week I believe my handling of my portfolio will not have so many misunderstandings. All in all this last week was a great learning experience because I have accumulated some necessary coding skills that I will use in my future classes and career.
