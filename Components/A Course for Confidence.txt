Hello fellow classmates. My name is Casey. I work a full time job, am a full time parent, and a full time student. I am taking the mobile development program here at Full Sail. I currently work an interesting job as a coin grader but have come to the realization that my current position is a dead end one. This has driven me to take my life in a new direction and open doors in fields that I never have imagined my life would head. Having worked construction jobs I know that the elements that surround it are not ideal for long-term health and the pay is considerably low, thus falling under my potential.My number one goal I have set out to achieve would have to be to get a job with opportunities of advancement. The pay range is important for this position because I am longing for the moment where I can set a goal for retirement. The dream side of this goal would to be able to create an application or program that could set me up for retirement. I have made it a goal to live by a saying, “Work to live, do not live to work.”Staying focused and managing time will be the only challenges that this month will present. No matter what my job is I always aspire to be the best. My hard work and proactivity has driven me through my journey here at Full Sail so far. I intend on continuing the use of these skills to propel me through my dream to achieve my life goals.Being new to coding I know that there is a large variety of languages and platforms. I believe it will be a struggle learning them but I am confident that I will be able to prevail.A few months back I did a report on an application developer named Dennis Crowley. Dennis was and is a normal, fun loving; young man that created an app that has ultimately made him rich. Getting rich is not necessary, but is warranted. I do not need to have a billion dollar idea or product. I just want to live a “free” life; free of stress, free of worry, and freedom to go wherever whenever.
