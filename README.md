    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring mobile application developer with a dream to one day build applications that can be used and enjoyed by people around the globe. I am currently attending Full Sail University one year into my mobile development program. I have created small web pages using HTML and beginner programs in the C# language. At this point it's early in my career and I have alot more work to do, but I have sown some promissing progress so far. When I'm not studing I love to be active by running, lifting weights, and playing golf. I wish to live the words "work to live, not live to work."</p>
