    <h1>Casey Scott</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a Mobile Development graduate from Full Sail University where I studied mobile application programming. I have experience in several languages like Java, Swift, C# and a few others. This is a repo of a collection of all the work I have done during my degree program. Many of these files contain small projects that focus on one core functionality.You may notice that the C# files are very basic and resemble the work of a beginner programmer. C# is where I started learning the basics of object oriented programming. As I progressed I made my way into Swift where I created many projects in the Xcode IDE. Finally my latest work is in the form of Java and has been developed in the Android Studio IDE.Currently at the time of this update I am creating my first Android application that will hopefully make its way to the Google Play store. This application is called ONTIME, it is a business management solution that is focused on time clocking and scheduling. Updates on this will soon be published.</p></section>
